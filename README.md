# Materials for the CRI Open Science course

At the _Center for Research & Interdisciplinarity_ in Paris the Master students of the _digital_, _learning_ and _life_ sciences take a joint course on Open Science in their first year. After a two-day kick-off workshop this course is designed around project-based learning in which interdisciplinary teams of 4-6 students run their own small research project from start to finish over the course of 12 weeks. To facilitate their work they are accompanied by fortnightly group sessions and the course materials we are sharing here.
